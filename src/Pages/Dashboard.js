        Hello, I'm trying to use the ARRAY datatype for sequelize with PostgreSQL. However I'm not exactly sure how to utilize it. I know how to set it on the schema but how do you push new items onto the array with a write and retrieve a specific index from the array in a query, etc.

I tried going to the docs to figure this out however theres not much documentation on this as opposed to other datatypes. If this comes up a lot I would be glad to add docs to it if you can explain it to me.
